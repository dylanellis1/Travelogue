        <h2>Canmore, Alberta Canada</h2>
        <img src="c:\Users\dgame\Downloads\IMG_3477.JPG" alt="Bench View Canmore">
        <p>Canmore which is also my hometown, is a medium sized town located to in the mountains of Alberta. It 15 minutes away from the big tourist attraction Banff. Its one of my favourite places due to the fact ive spent a major chunk of my life in Canmore and the beautiful mountains surrounding. This specific photo was taken by a bench near my old house in Three Sisters.</p>

    <section id="location2">
        <h2>Banff, Alberta Canada</h2>
        <img src="c:\Users\dgame\Downloads\IMG_1866.JPG" alt="Mountain View Banff">
        <p>Banff is one of Canadas biggest tourist locations located an hour outside of the city of Calgary. Its one of my favourite spots because it is 15 minutes from my house and I have a lot of friends who live in Banff. I also love the mountains, nature and the air there. If you come and visit Banff or Canmore you should definetly go skiing at least once while you are there!</p>

        <h2>San Fransisco, USA California</h2>
        <img src="c:\Users\dgame\Desktop\San Fransisco.jpg" alt="Alcatraz Island San Fransisco">
        <p>San Fransisco is located further away than my other favourite locations, however, we do trips out there because we have relatives living there. I like it mainly due to the foggy weather and it being close to the water. As well as the fact that it also has a nice city and country beside eachother. Lastly, I love just going out there and having insightful conversations with my family while enjoying the different views.</p>
